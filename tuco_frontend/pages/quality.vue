            >At Tuco we perform our quality control by running tests and samples of our products and materials on a regular basis through the whole production process. Besides testing the tensile strength and elasticity the hardening values of each molding is measured in order to ensure our high quality.
              <br>
              <br>For each individual project Tuco makes quality papers. Documentation, quality procedures and manuals follow the manufacturing process. The quality papers are specified down to each single subject, gathering, assemblage, molding and surface treatment. Each subject and part is given it’s own number to obtain the highest possible level of traceability.  The operator performing the task fills out the papers and at the same time every step is supervised and signed for by the quality inspector assigned to the project. The quality inspector is responsible for the project.

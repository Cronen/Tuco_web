            <p>
              At Tuco we perform our quality control by running tests and samples of our products and materials on a regular basis through the whole production process. Besides testing the tensile strength and elasticity the hardening values of each molding is measured in order to ensure our high quality.
              <br>
              <br>For each individual project Tuco makes quality papers. Documentation, quality procedures and manuals follow the manufacturing process. The quality papers are specified down to each single subject, gathering, assemblage, molding and surface treatment. Each subject and part is given it’s own number to obtain the highest possible level of traceability. The operator performing the task fills out the papers and at the same time every step is supervised and signed for by the quality inspector assigned to the project. The quality inspector is responsible for the project.

              Tuco has many years of experience with manufacturing vessels approved by different classification companies and we have collaborated with companies like Lloyds and DNV to their full satisfaction.
              <br>
              <br>When working on class approved projects – besides Tuco’s own quality control – there are frequent visits by specialist quality inspectors from the classification company in question. Tuco has a close and good cooperation with the classification company on regularly optimizing the quality- and production documentation.

                Carbon fiber is a material consisting of fibers of about 5 - 10 μm in diameter – mainly carbon atoms. Several thousand carbon fibers are bundled together to form a string that can be used on it’s own or woven into a cloth.
                <br>
                <br>The properties of carbon fiber - like high degree of stiffness, high tensile strength and elasticity, low weight, high chemical resistance, high degree of temperature resilience and tolerance and low thermic expansion, are all properties that has made carbon fiber a popular material in aerospace science, the military, motorsports, industrial production and several competitive sports.
                <br>When carbon fiber is combined with other materials a composite is created. When combined with plastic materials carbon fiber reinforced plastic is created. These types of materials have a very high strength to weight relationship.

                <b>Synergy effect by achieving weight reductions</b>
              </h2>
              <p class>
                The high strength contra weight ratio of carbon fiber makes it possible to reduce the weight significantly while maintaining the desired strength in a given construction. When carbon fiber is used the weight is reduced significantly which leads to a large reduction in the level of fuel consumption, which again leads to a reduction in the CO2-emission.
                <br>
                <br>Example:
                <br>By choosing carbon fiber -> Hull weight is reduced -> reduction in operational power -> requires a smaller engine -> lower overall weight -> less fuel consumption -> less CO2-emission. This also opens the possibility of using the advantage of the lower weight by allowing more passengers or larger cargo and thereby heightening the effectiveness of the vessel.
